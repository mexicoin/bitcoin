Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of mexicoin.

The contribution workflow is described in

The developer 
should be used to discuss complicated or controversial changes before working
on a patch set.

Developer IRC can be found on Freenode at 

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write  for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in

There are also [regression and integration tests] written
in...., that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run  are installed with:

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
